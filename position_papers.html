            We have two main goals in attending this workshop. First,
            the policy and Trust & Safety teams of
            many technology platforms around the world are focused on the role user-generated content created
            through generative AI tools may play in impacting elections, helping propagate misinformation,
            and scale financial fraud operations. While important work, this narrow focus misses other harmful
            forms of user-generated content, including IBSA. It is crucial to recognize the significant harms
            associated with AI-generated IBSA, which at first glance, may feel less critical. Moreover, effective
            interventions require multi-disciplinary collaboration among ML researchers, engineers, policy
            teams, and scholarly experts. Second, our goal in attending this workshop is to better understand
            how other researchers explain complicated concepts to research participants, and identify angles
            we may have missed in our prospective research plans. Below, we briefly detail the methods and
            results of our original research, concluding with a brief summary of our prospective survey format.

        <p>Online communities whose topics focus on Generative AI (Gen-AI) serves as venues for learning and sharing
            content from Gen-AI tools. Employing a case study approach, this work examines theMidjourney communities
            on Discord, Facebook, and Reddit. On each platform, affordances and boundary regulation shape community
            interaction. AI users may come into contact with AI critics or less engaged members of the lay public on
            each platform. Moderators face distinct challenges on each platform, which underscores the importance of
            community management for Gen-AI discussions online.

        <p>The widespread availability of deepfake technologies presents unprecedented challenges in addressing the
            spread of misinformation. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of generating realistic
            and convincing deepfakes, the possibility of generating audio and video content that can be used to subtly
            manipulate people into believing and spreading misinformation is now a realistic threat. Our work aims to
            study the subtle manipulation of people using familiar voices in deepfake based misinformation. In
            particular, we intend to find the effects of familiarity in the believability of information. The primary
            focus for this work is on the believability of misinformation conveyed by synthetic voices that contain
            voice characteristics of popular celebrities whose voices are found to be familiar to young adults belonging
            to Generation Z (aged between 18 to 26). A primary quantitative study has been conducted within the United
            States (N = 110) to identify celebrity voices familiar to the Generation Z population. With the top 6
            celebrities identified, another quantitative experiment was conducted (N = 102) to identify deepfake voice
            clones of the selected celebrities that retain a varying degree of familiarity present in the original
            voice. This is a work in progress, and we aim to study the susceptibility of the general population,
            children, and older adults to such familiar deepfakes.

        <p>Generative artificial intelligence is making profound impact on multimedia content creation and consumption.
            This position paper discusses a potential future model of these activities, where multimodal intelligent
            agents
            select, recommend, and generate content on behalf of content creators in response to consumer input and
            behaviors. We identify technical challenges for building and evaluating such agents, design considerations

            Generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool with the potential to complement human creativity and support
            mental well-being.
            This abstract aims to investigate the applications of generative AI within therapeutic contexts,
            particularly focusing on therapies
            involving creative activities (e.g., music therapy and art therapy). Our recent research has explored the
            role of generative AI in
            enhancing the practice of therapists in music therapy sessions and its utility in facilitating
            music-based reminiscence activities
            for older adults. The proliferation of therapeutic content on video platforms such as TikTok, YouTube,
            and Bilibili, including
            Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), music therapy sessions, and mindfulness exercises, has created
            a new ecosystem
            where creators are constantly seeking innovative ways to engage their audience. Generative AI stands at the
            forefront of this creative
            quest, offering content creators a suite of tools to foster enhanced creativity and productivity. Therefore,
            I am interested in discussing
            the following topics in this workshop.

            Generative AI (gen-AI) tool offers unprecedented capabilities for creating content. Images, text and
            video are the most popular applications of gen-AI, with models such as StableDiffusion and
            ChatGPT amassing thousands of users. Innovation does not look set to slow down, with the
            recent release of impressive text-to-video model, Sora. Understandably, the rapid adoption of
            new gen-AI tools has precipitated a number of concerns, such as the rise of deepfakes, fake news,
            copyright infringement and job displacement. However, with adoption of gen-AI technologies
            only looking to increase, it is essential to foster safe, useful and fruitful human-AI interactions.
            User-generated content is a prime example of such interaction. UGC — any content made by a user
            and not a brand — dominates social media sites as other users seek authentic, credible, relevant
            and relatable content. Gen-AI offers opportunities for users to generate ideas, images, scripts
            and captions, among countless other applications.

            The phenomenon of deepfake, leveraging generative AI to create hyper-realistic videos and audio
            recordings, presents a formidable challenge in the digital age, blurring the lines between reality and
            fabrication with implications for privacy, security, and trust. This study addresses the critical research
            question of how deepfake technology affects the detection of cybercrime, particularly through the
            impersonation of individuals. Grounded in Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT), the research
            modiRies traditional constructs to encompass the unique characteristics of deepfakes. The empirical
            investigation faces hurdles in acquiring authentic deepfake data and ethical concerns, addressed
            through a mixed-method approach including sentiment analysis of online videos, controlled
            experiments, and semi-structured interviews. Preliminary Rindings indicate varied public perceptions
            of deepfakes, inRluenced signiRicantly by the content's context. This research contributes to the HCI
            Rield by elucidating the dynamic interaction between deepfake technology and human cognition,
            offering insights for developing more effective cybercrime detection and prevention strategies.

            Generative AI (Gen-AI) has come to the center of attention in the advertisement industry
            worldwide. Marketers and influencers are key actors who celebrate the most up-to-date
            Gen-AI technologies. The reception of Gen-AI is mixed: it is heralded as a creative and
            liberating tool for generating innovative and captivating content ideas, yet there is a
            concurrent concern among advertising professionals about the potential for technology
            to replace human labor.
            <br>
            Our analysis centers the empirical cases from Xiaohongshu (RED), a prominent social
            media platform in China that merges social media functionalities with e-commerce.
            RED, known for its emphasis on text-, image-, and video-based content, mirrors the
            influencer marketing practices found on global platforms like Instagram and earns
            over 80% of revenues through advertisement. Among existing usage of Gen-AI for
            marketing purposes, we focus on a particular kind of content generation: the content
            generated by social media influencers.We specifically examine “Key Opinion Consumers
            (KOCs)”—ordinary platform users who carry advertorial content on RED. Given their
            authenticity and relatability to everyday consumers, they are popular advertisement
            agents for commercial brands. KOC marketing campaign on the RED platform is an
            established business model in the industry. Our previous work (under review) has pointed
            out that integrating KOCs into marketing campaigns requires labor from multiple actors,
            including KOC themselves, marketers, and talent brokers (i.e. multiple-channel-network
            agencies).

            many
            innovative benefits in the world of content creation, there are some unethical usage that poses significant
            risks

            As generative AI tools gain popularity, online communities are forced to adapt their policies and practices
            to
            deal with the arrival of AI-generated content (AIGC). While some communities may welcome this new form
            of participation, others will view it as an existential threat. Our prior work interviewing Reddit
            moderators
            suggests that AIGC is uniquely threatening to communities who value authenticity and factuality. These
            communities may enact rules banning AIGC, but without foolproof detection tools, enforcement by human
            moderators is challenging and relies on flawed heuristics. In future work we would like to explore design
            interventions that can help moderators from these communities adapt to this new reality. Additionally, for
            communities that welcome AIGC, we would like to study how the presence of AIGC impacts discussion
            dynamics, user participation, and community trust. We hope to complement our qualitative methods with
            computational techniques that will enable platform-wide measurements of the impacts of AIGC. Reddit’s
            distributed self-governance model makes it an ideal site of study for HCI researchers who are interested in
            studying how communities adapt to technological change. We hope to eventually perform similar studies on
            different platforms that take a top-down governance approach, such as StackOverflow, to see what we can
            learn from platforms with different governance paradigms.

            The prevalent use of social media has increased attention on the content created by content creators.
            Previous academic research has investigated the factors that foster audience engagement with
            content creators, focusing on concepts like parasocial and trans-parasocial interaction.
            Similarly, our research aligns with these findings, highlighting that reciprocal interaction plays a crucial
            role
            in bolstering audience engagement. This dynamic is particularly evident in the context of live streaming,
            where streamers enhance engagement through direct interactions, such as real-time comments, collaboratively
            shaping the content and atmosphere.
            <br>
            However, research on the auditory experience within the context of live streaming is limited, despite its
            proven effectiveness in enhancing emotional engagement across various domains, such as gaming.
            Particularly, the potential of live streams’ interactive nature to enrich the auditory experience of viewers
            remains underexplored. Existing studies on auditory experience have predominantly focused on background
            music and its static and non-interactive attributes, neglecting the interactive opportunities in live
            streaming. In recent times, the significance of background music in content creation has begun to attract
            academic interest. Background music is commonly used to complement visual content in nonstreaming
            videos, and platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube have facilitated the integration
            of music into the content creation workflow, simplifying the process of adding background music while
            also enhancing user convenience. Exploring the use of auditory experiences to increase viewer engagement
            presents a compelling opportunity for research into how live streaming can adjust various musical elements
            to support different interaction contexts.

            Our research team at BYU has been studying the capabilities of Gen-AI in creating spear
            phishing messages, as compared to trained humans. We have employed a novel approach,
            wherein we recruited “targets” who share personal information about themselves (e.g., job
            title and location; personal hobby; something they have posted about online) and agree to
            return later for an interview. We then have humans who have been trained on how to create
            effective spear phishing messages create them based on the information provided by the
            targets. We also have Gen-AI (i.e, ChatGPT-4) generate spear phishing messages using the
            same prompts we gave the humans. Finally, we invite the targets back and show them 12
            spear phishing messages created to target them based on the information they provided. They
            are asked to “sort” the messages from most compelling to least compelling and discuss why
            they placed them where they did. After the sorting and discussion, they are told that one or
            more of the messages were created by AI. They are asked to place a token (with the letters
            AI) on any they believe were created by AI and explain why they chose those ones and not
            others. We are currently analyzing the data for 28 targets. Preliminary results suggest that
            Gen-AI is slightly more effective at creating personalized spear phishing messages than
            trained humans. And this is based on an off-the-shelf Large Language Model (LLM) and a very
            basic prompt (“Create a spear phishing…”). Furthermore, most targets have no idea which
            messages were created by AI and don’t have an accurate mental model of how to even
            approach that question. Through this project and future projects on the creation of
            disinformation messages, images, and videos in the form of hypothetical social media posts,
            we hope to demonstrate the capabilities (and potentially limitations) of Gen-AI in
            personalizing disinformation. This is a necessary step in order to identify and Olag such
            content so the risks associated with fraud and disinformation can be mitigated.

            Generative AI is reshaping the boundaries of creativity and productivity across every field. Idea
            crowdsourcing
            platforms rely on user creative engagement to solve problems, innovate, and co-create value through the
            collective intelligence of individuals. Traditional idea-generation methods may limit idea novelty and
            diversity
            and require significant human creativity. Boosting creativity is an imperative requirement of the idea
            crowdsourcing
            platforms, where creativity is a complex phenomenon to measure. To solve this problem, we propose
            a generative AI model that works in two steps: 1) evaluates the creativity scores of users’ ideas through
            the
            uniqueness, diversity, and feasibility scores calculated using the idea pool and peer and manager’s feedback
            and 2) provides prompts designs to stimulate, enhance and refine the idea’s quality of individual users
            based
            on the calculated creativity scores. We propose a framework for future research into creativity enhancement
            through generative AI in idea crowdsourcing platforms. This framework can help users enhance their creative
            contributions and help platform administrators identify high-potential ideas that may not receive high
            votes.

            As AI-generated figures, photos, and videos become increasingly common, individuals struggle to
            discern genuine content from fabricated ones. With younger generations growing up surrounded by
            media saturated with easily created fake content, the concepts of ’authenticity’ have transformed.
            Consequently, alongside ’credibility’ and ’trustworthiness’, authenticity emerges as a crucial concept
            for comprehending the consumers’ perception in the contemporary media landscape. Authenticity
            pertains to staying true to oneself. Authenticity is not regarded as an inherent quality of an
            object but rather as a reflection of one’s own beliefs, expectations, and perspectives. Thus,
            authenticity can be built in even a fabricated context if it meets users’ expectations. In short,
            authenticity refers to an entity’s ability to align with users’ expectations of a platform or content
            by creating a relevant schematic fit. Although AI-generated content was once considered fake,
            our understanding of how this perception is evolving remains limited, particularly as users become
            more knowledgeable about the uses of generative AI in content creation. We aim to explore how
            AI-generated content affects users’ perception of authenticity on social media.

            This position paper explores the integration of Generative AI (Gen-AI) technologies, specifically Large
            Language Models (LLMs), to foster reflection among users in the context of User-Generated Content (UGC) on
            online platforms. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, this paper proposes a novel approach to
            organically
            induce reflection in users before they contribute to online spaces. This paper elucidates the mechanisms
            through which Gen-AI technologies can facilitate reflective engagement, going beyond the mere generation of
            information content. Ultimately, this paper advocates for the strategic integration of Gen-AI technologies
            to
            enhance the quality and depth of UGC on online platforms, thereby enriching the collective discourse and
            fostering a more reflective online community.
